# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Create a professional resume using the following details in a clean HTML and CSS format. Only include sections that have relevant information from the user’s input.

Details:
- Name: {{fullName}}
- Email: {{email}}
- Phone: {{phone}}
- Location: {{location}}
- Summary: {{summary}} (Only include if summary is provided)
- Skills: {{skills}} (Only include if skills are provided)
- Education: {{education}} (Only include if education details are provided)
- Experience: {{experience}} (Only include if experience details are provided)
- Projects: {{projects}} (Only include if projects are provided)
- Certifications: {{certifications}} (Only include if certifications are provided)

Please ensure the resume is designed professionally in a clean, modern, and easy-to-read HTML format with inline CSS. Omit sections that do not have data provided by the user. The final HTML should be minimal, without extra tags, and should focus on neat, simple styling. Ensure that the resume has:
- A clear header with the user’s name, contact info (email, phone, location)
- A professional summary section (if provided)
- Skills, education, experience, projects, and certifications sections (only if data is provided)

Output only the HTML code with embedded CSS, formatted properly for web presentation.
Key Features:
Conditional Sections: Sections like "Summary," "Skills," etc., will only be included if the user has provided that information.

Inline CSS: The HTML will include basic inline CSS for a clean and modern look.

Minimal and Clean Output: The resume will not include empty sections or unnecessary elements, focusing only on the provided data.
